FUNCTIONS :

JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.

Advantage of JavaScript function :

There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.

1. Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding.
2. Less coding: It makes our program compact. We donâ€™t need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.



The syntax of declaring function is :

function functionName([arg1, arg2, ...argN]){  
 //code to be executed  
}
